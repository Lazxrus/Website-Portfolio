<!--What Da Things Do-->

<!--Version of HTML, some tags may not work w-out it(article, footer, header)-->
<!--Sets the language of the page/helps readers w pronunciation-->
<!--A Unicode-based encoding-->
<!--This tag renders the width of the page to the width of the device's screen size.-->
<!--This text is shown in the browser's title bar.-->

<!--Just personal opinion go into learning programming or a new programming language by designing a tool you want to create.

Regardless of complexity. If you force to write the tool or program in the coding language your learning, your bound to learn it.

IE, ftp client, calculator, chess program, torrent client, program that turns off the light at random interval in the living room when someone walks by, but not every time , in some cases it turns off a active light switch,just pick something your interested in.!-->
